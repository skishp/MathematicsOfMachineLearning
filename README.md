## Lecture: Mathematics of Machine Learning 

Unfortunately in the winter semester 2022 this lecture will be hold from a professor of the numeric department. This especially impacts the exercises, since there are much less programming exercises and more "do it by hand" exercises. For this reason there will be a folder `ML2021` where i will do the coding exercises of the lecture from the previous year, since there are weakly coding exercises. 

Nonetheless I will upload my exercises and solutions as a pdf written in latex in the folder `ML2022`. 

In the coding exercises I will be using anaconda and creating for each exercise one environment where I install the needed libraries. 
To list all existing conda environments simply run 
``` 
conda env list
``` 
in the terminal. 
To create our environment for this exercise run 
```
conda create --name myenv
```
where `myenv` is your chosen name for the environment. The last thing you have to do is do actually activate the created environment. To do this run
```
conda activate myenv
```
and now you are ready to go.
